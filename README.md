My largest React project so far 

A simple, single-page-app weath app that uses Openweathermap's free API to fetch current time and weather data for any location of your choice. There is also an option to expand the app with forecasts.

Used multiple libraries such as styled-components, luxon, react-scroll.

Learned a lot about styling using styled-components, reading other people's code and API calls.
